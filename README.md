# CSC365-final-project

This project contains the components to create a website with 3 pages, using the Spotify API to get songs from an Artist's profile.

The Twitter API will then be used so that users can share the Artist's songs to their Twitter feed.

Documentation for the Spotify API can be found here: https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/

I _think_ this is the right Twitter API documentation, but there are a lot of different kinds (e.g. data analytics, advertising, etc.): https://developer.twitter.com/en/use-cases/publish-and-curate
